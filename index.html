On average, about 5,000 openings per year are expected over the decade, with many stemming from the need to replace workers transitioning to other occupations or retiring from the workforce.

          <p>The demand for archivists is projected to rise due to the increasing volume of information and records in both public and private organizations, particularly with the growing prevalence of electronic records. Similarly, the continued public interest in museums and cultural centers is anticipated to drive up demand for curators, museum technicians, and conservators. However, changes to the federal budget may affect archives and museums receiving federal funds, potentially impacting the employment of archivists, curators, museum technicians, and conservators.

          <p>Since digitization of moving-image material has become so integral to access and preservation, employers in the field are increasingly looking for candidates with experience in digital forensics, data recovery, and museum digitization initiatives more broadly. Familiarity with cultural heritage preservation practices is also in demand, as well as strategies for how to engage audiences in education and programing initiatives. Another helpful skill to have is familiarity with machine learning and artificial intelligence for media analysis.</p>

              <h6>“In any archival position where you're handling large sets of data on spreadsheets, it can be very overwhelming. OpenRefine has been a pretty life changing tool...it's taught in the metadata class. I highly recommend it to all library school students."</h6>

            <p>Neither of our information professionals completed internships during their MLIS programs.

          <p>Rhian encouraged MLIS students to take advantage of as many technical skills classes as possible, being intentional to take ones that would be applicable to both archiving and librarianship, like coding and server maintenance. But his favorite class from his MLIS was a class called <i>Issues in Academic Librarianship:</i></p>
          <br><br>
          <div class="quote">
            <h6>"It was a writing intensive class and required me to do a literature review per week, analyzing one issue.  So I was like, okay, I need to pay attention to these issues to make sure that I'm coming out of this with the ability to speak on them and, hopefully, be a change agent...so that in whatever institution I land in, [I can say] let's address this, let's answer these questions.”

          <p>We have unique backgrounds which aren't always conducive to certain methods of gaining experience. Rhian spoke of being an adult student with a newborn daughter:</p>
          <br><br>
          <div class="quote">
            <h6>“I created a checklist, I wanted to be able to tick off as many boxes as I could by the time I finished my degree to make sure I was as competitive of a candidate as possible. I knew I was entering the job market with less hands-on experience than other people. I didn't have the ability to do internships, I had a newborn daughter, so there were some things that were just off the table for me. I really wanted to be as proactive as possible during my MLIS, to leverage that and be really prepared.”

        <p>The Covid-19 pandemic highlighted the limitations of DEI efforts in addressing systemic inequalities within these fields. DEI initiatives often fail to address issues such as fair compensation, job security, and power imbalances within institutions. Many information science (IS) professionals, such as curators and archivists, have begun to create their unions and communities in response to politics, layoffs, and power imbalances over the past four years.<br><br>
          Among these communities, salary sharing has become one of the biggest practices in curatorial and librarianship circles. This fosters transparency and empowers workers to advocate for fair compensation based on industry norms and individual qualifications. Much of this sharing and collaborative conversation about work experiences takes place on social media, making these professions more interconnected and visible to the public.<br><br>
          The second trend most discussed by IS professionals is AI. When AI became prominent last year, it seemed to cause mass hysteria that it could replace almost all jobs. However, many information science professionals believe otherwise, suggesting that instead, AI might enhance and provoke larger conversations about trust, transparency, and bias in information systems.<br><br><br>
