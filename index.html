        <h3>We are aspiring archivists and information professionals with commitments to preserve and make accessible cultural heritage and moving-image art. This site is designed to support those interested in beginning a career as an archivist or research librarian, especially those considering or currently in an MLIS program. We share some of the skills required to enter and excel in the field, introduce the current professional climate, offer resources and perspectives on what working in the field looks like, and how that may shift in the future. We attempt to keep the information broad enough to pertain to early career information professionals of all stripes, but also offer some more niche perspectives on special topics such as preserving time-based media artwork. Our dossier reflects our own independent research as well as insights gathered through interviews conducted with two amazing information professionals</h3><h1 class="colon">:</h1>

On average, about 5,000 openings per year are expected over the decade, with many stemming from the need to replace workers transitioning to other occupations or retiring from the workforce.

          <p>The demand for archivists is projected to rise due to the increasing volume of information and records in both public and private organizations, particularly with the growing prevalence of electronic records. Similarly, the continued public interest in museums and cultural centers is anticipated to drive up demand for curators, museum technicians, and conservators. However, changes to the federal budget may affect archives and museums receiving federal funds, potentially impacting the employment of archivists, curators, museum technicians, and conservators.
